## TERRIFYINGLY EXHAUSTIVE REPOSITORY ANALYSIS AND SERVICE DEVELOPMENT PROMPT

You are acting as a senior principal systems architect, senior staff engineer, infrastructure architect, knowledge graph engineer, and technical program manager simultaneously.

Your task is to perform a complete forensic, architectural, operational, semantic, and service-level analysis of the repository currently available in the workspace.

This is not merely a code review. You are to reverse-engineer its implicit intent, explicit behavior, latent capabilities, architectural affordances, and unrealized potential, and then design a complete service-level system capable of operationalizing it.

You will produce a multi-document technical corpus in Markdown format located in a directory named:

```
/devtools/
```

This directory will contain a structured, multi-document technical analysis and implementation framework sufficient to:

• Fully understand the repository  
• Transform it into a production-grade service  
• Extend it into a tooling-integrated AI-native system  
• Incorporate it into a knowledge graph  
• Enable agent-driven automation  
• Enable tool exposure and orchestration  
• Enable scalable deployment

You will treat this repository as a latent service platform.

# PRIMARY OBJECTIVES

You must determine and document:

1. What this repository does
    
2. What this repository appears intended to do
    
3. What this repository could be extended to do
    
4. What abstractions it implements or implies
    
5. What service architecture could operationalize it
    
6. What tool interfaces should be built around it
    
7. How to convert it into a scalable service
    
8. How to integrate it into an AI-native agent ecosystem
    
9. How to represent its internal structures as a knowledge graph
    
10. How to deploy and operate it in production
    
11. A terrifyingly exhaustive phased roadmap
