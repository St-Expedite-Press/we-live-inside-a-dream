# Research Path

Use this path when the initial prompt is research-oriented.

## Entry Criteria
- Objective is analysis/synthesis, not immediate code mutation.
- Deliverable requires evidence-backed findings, comparisons, or citations.

## Node Sequence
1. `library/graph/nodes/exploratory/objective_intake_and_context_map.md`
2. `library/graph/nodes/planning/product_plan_compiler.md`
3. `library/graph/nodes/implementation/service_industrializer.md` (analysis mode only)

## Required Outputs
- Research question decomposition.
- Evidence ledger.
- Synthesis report with explicit uncertainties.
- Recommended next actions (implementation optional, not implied).

## Exit Criteria
- Findings are traceable to evidence.
- Open unknowns are explicit.
- Any implementation suggestion is separated from research conclusions.
