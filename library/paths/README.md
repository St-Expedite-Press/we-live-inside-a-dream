# Paths (Runnable Prompt Flows)

This folder contains **paths**: opinionated, step-by-step prompt flows that turn a goal into a controlled chain of prompts, with explicit decision points and artifacts.

Paths are meant to be used alongside:

`library/prompts/execution/chain_router_and_runbook.md`. `library/prompts/execution/chain_execution_protocol.md`.
## Available paths

Objective to product phase pipeline: `library/paths/common/objective_to_product_pipeline.md`. Python image restoration pipeline: `library/paths/python/image_restoration_pipeline.md`. Rust image restoration pipeline: `library/paths/rust/image_restoration_pipeline.md`.
## Templates

Templates for runbooks and decision records: `library/paths/_templates/`.
