# Paths (Runnable Prompt Flows)

This folder contains **paths**: opinionated, step-by-step prompt flows that turn a goal into a controlled chain of prompts, with explicit decision points and artifacts.

Paths are meant to be used alongside:

- `library/prompts/execution/chain_router_and_runbook.md`
- `library/prompts/execution/chain_execution_protocol.md`

## Available paths

- Python image restoration pipeline: `library/paths/python/image_restoration_pipeline.md`
- Rust image restoration pipeline: `library/paths/rust/image_restoration_pipeline.md`
